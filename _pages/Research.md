## OR Project during Phd Study

Apply optimization models to solve practical problems.

### Revisiting Continuous p-Hub Location Problems with the L1 Metric
- Analytical results presented in **IISE 2024** (Thanks, Joe).
- Presented in **2024 INFORMS Annual Meeting**.
- Submitted to the Transportation Science.
- Approximation method and case study will be present in **IISE 2025**.

### Hurricane Evacuation
- Ongoing Research

### Search and Rescue
- Ongoing Research

## Other Project before Phd Study 

A little bit interdisciplinary. I actually received my PhD offer from the Human Factors track under Industrial Engineering Department. Then, I changed my mind.

### Brain-computer Interface
- EEG signal processing.
- BCI (SSVEP) pattern design.
  
### Robotic System Design
- Autonomous driving system (SLAM part).
- BCI-based robotic system design: BCI-based wheelchair,BCI-based typing sysytem, and BCI-based UAV (invited to exhibit at the World Robot Conference, WRC, in Beijing).

### Mechanical Design
- Design and simulation of bionic elbow joint based on rigid-compliant structure.
